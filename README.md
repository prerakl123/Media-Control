# EZ-MEDIA CONTROL
This program keeps a small window at 20% transparency at the bottom left corner of the screen.

You can access the basic Media Controls:
- Volume Up/Down
- Next/Previous Media
- Play/Pause Media
- Volume Slider control

When the mouse enters the window it goes on 100% transparency and clearly displays all the controls.
The hold and move mouse control with the slider is limited to 90% to avoid sudden increase in volume, while you can click at the end
of the slider line or simply scroll upto get to 100%.
